[Excerpt][]

Textadept is a fast, minimalist, and remarkably extensible cross-platform text editor for
programmers. This quick reference contains a wealth of knowledge on how to script and configure
Textadept using the Lua programming language. It groups the editor's rich API into a series of
tasks in a convenient and easy-to-use manner.

This book covers how to:

* Leverage Textadept's important files and folders
* Adeptly navigate and manipulate text
* Mark lines and text visually
* Show interactive lists and call tips
* Prompt for user input in various ways
* Spawn asynchronous, interactive child processes
* Configure colors, themes, and other settings
* Define lexers for highlighting source code
* And much more

It serves as the perfect complement to Textadept's comprehensive Manual and exhaustive API
documentation.

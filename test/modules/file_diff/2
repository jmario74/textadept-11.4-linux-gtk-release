that is the first paragraph
    this is the second line
third line starts with space
- starts with a minus sign
	this one with two tab
			now with full three tabs
	now there are tabs		everywhere, much fun

this line won't change

two lines are going to
(entirely magically,
 assuming this works)
be changed into four!

three of those lines have
collapsed onto one

this is the last line
